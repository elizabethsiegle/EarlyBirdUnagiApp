We had a blast presenting our Android app after a week of learning and working together with both our 4-person team, the 12 other Early Birds who came from all over the US, and especially with the Twitter Fabric team engineers and developer advocates. We won "best pitch," and our slides can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zwEccfc0LGnIxR6opYCa8ZYC5wTijwccLrEFHpE83t0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

Whenever the user posts a task, it is posted to their Twitter account, holding the person accountable for their task or goal. When the task is either completed on time, a positive Tweet is posted. Else, if it is not completed on time, the app posts a more negative Tweet for not getting it done in time. There is no option to delete tasks.
We used Twitter's Fabric API (RIP) for the login portion, as well as for the posting. Similarly, for the list of activities, we used RecyclerView instead of ListView.
